## 计算法线变换矩阵的另一种方法

<!-- * Note that the inverse-transpose of a matrix is equal to its cofactor matrix divided by its
* determinant:
*
*     transpose(inverse(M)) = cof(M) / det(M)
*
* The cofactor matrix is faster to compute than the inverse-transpose, and it can be argued
* that it is a more correct way of transforming normals anyway. Some references from Dale
* Weiler, Nathan Reed, Inigo Quilez, and Eric Lengyel:
*
*   - https://github.com/graphitemaster/normals_revisited
*   - http://www.reedbeta.com/blog/normals-inverse-transpose-part-1/
*   - https://www.shadertoy.com/view/3s33zj
*   - FGED Volume 1, section 1.7.5 "Inverses of Small Matrices"
*   - FGED Volume 1, section 3.2.2 "Transforming Normal Vectors"
*
* In "Transforming Normal Vectors", Lengyel notes that there are two types of transformed
* normals: one that uses the transposed adjugate (aka cofactor matrix) and one that uses the
* transposed inverse. He goes on to say that this difference is inconsequential, except when
* mirroring is involved. -->
